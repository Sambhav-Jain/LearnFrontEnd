        <h1>Infamous Browser Wars</h1>
    </header>
    <p>
        The web browsers in modern times are supported by almost every device that can connect to the internet. We use web browsers to access information on the World wide web. Mostly, web browsers are used on personal computers, laptops, android and IOS devices, and other operating systems. Today, the browser market share is dominated by Google Chrome web browser. From the simple static HTML browsing to single-page web applications, and, the way web browsers are working on smartphones, the web browsers have come a long way.
        <br>
        The <strong>“browser wars”</strong>, that started in the early phase of the web for the ultimate dominance in the usage share of browsers. It revolutionised the way the internet works today.
    </p>
        <h2>How Web Became What is it Today?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><h3>Mosaic</h3>
                <p>
                    The first web browser, WorldWideWeb was created by <a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee" target = "blank">Tim Berners-Lee</a> who also invented the World wide web. It was released for the next step in 1991. Further, next year many other browsers for different platforms came out. These browsers were only simple HTML-Viewers software. The web was very different it consisted of very few web pages line after line only text everywhere. They were used by universities to share and read research papers, most used by geeks. This nerd was no other than Illinois computer science student <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Andreessen" target = "blank">Marc Andreesen</a>.
                    <br><br>
                    He worked at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) at the University of Illinois, where he became familiar with Tim Berners-Lee's open standards for the World Wide Web. Andreessen and full-time salaried co-worker <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Bina">Eric Bina</a> worked on creating a user-friendly browser with integrated graphics that would work on a wide range of computers. The resulting code was the  <a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosaic_(web_browser)" target = "blank">Mosaic </a> Web browser. Having just left Silicon graphics Jim Clark was looking for something new and Mosaic caught his attention. To common people word internet meant nothing but at the same time but he viewed it as a technology for world-dominance. A technology that would revolutionise the way things work in the world, that will bring even opposite poles closer than ever.

                    &quot;Several million then suddenly noticed that the Web might be better than sex.&quot;— Bob Metcalfe
                </p>
                <p>
                    Though, I personally don't like Marc or others that have ill intent towards my motherland. It is due to the <a href ="https://twitter.com/maheshmurthy/status/697290262427660289?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E697290262427660289&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fthenextweb.com%2Fin%2F2016%2F02%2F10%2Fmarc-andreessen-just-offended-1-billion-indians-with-a-single-tweet%2F" target = " blank">tweet</a> he made. India was under the control of the British for nearly 200 years. The economic catastrophe that Andreessen is referring to is the 30-odd years after the country gained independence in 1947, during which its growth rate was woefully low because of anti-free market policies. Andreessen’s notion of what is best for India is misguided and ill-informed, to say the least. Equally worrying is the fact that he believes India’s poorest don’t deserve the same open internet that he built his fortune on. Let us return to browser wars.

                <h3>Netscape</h3>
                    <p>
                        The popularity of the Mosaic was at the peak, but one of its developers, Marc Andreessen met with Jim Clark of silicon graphics. After he graduated from the University of Illinois, Andreessen and Jim Clark founded Mosaic Communications Corporation in 1994. Because of the conflicts with the University of Illinois, they changed the name to Netscape and thus released the Netscape navigator 0.9, a web browser. The browser was the most advanced available and was an instant success, becoming a market leader while still in beta. Netscape's feature-count and market share continued to grow rapidly after version 1.0 was released. Version 2.0 added a full mail reader called Netscape Mail, thus transforming Netscape from a mere web browser to an Internet suite. During this period, both the browser and the suite were known as Netscape Navigator.

                    <p>
                        By the end of 1995, the web boom set by the mosaic was overtaken by the Netscape navigator. The web was receiving a great amount of attention from the public and media, which led Microsoft in the competition. Thus leading to the first browser war. <strong>Microsoft vs Netscape</strong>
                    </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>War for dominance of The Web</h2>
            <ul>    
                <li>
                    <h3>Internet Explorer vs Netscape Navigator</h3>
                    Having the monopoly at the time, <a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netscape_(web_browser)" target ="blank">Netscape</a> offered its browser free for non-commercial users but demanded money for a license. The IPO was extremely successful for Netscape and newly added features such as frames, image maps, and javascript iterations were immensely influential. <a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Gates" target ="blank">Bill gates</a> realized how the web is going to make a big impact on the future. Microsoft was already dominating the operating system usage share with 90 per cent but Netscape was the one that dominated the web browsers usage share with 80 per cent. That means, if you are buying Microsoft windows, you need to a web browser separately.<br>
                    <strong>First spark: </strong>First, Microsoft sent its engineers to Netscape for discussing the future of Microsoft and the web. Things didn’t go well between Microsoft and Netscape, and after some time, the two companies rarely spoke. <ins>Microsoft comes in action</ins> as the Netscape’s popularity was increasing and then, just after 15 days of that IPO launch, Microsoft had their browser ready, the Internet Explorer. The Internet Explorer version one was released by Microsoft to challenge the Netscape navigator. Internet Explorer version one was nothing in front of the world-class web browser of that time. Only a little damage was done to the Netscape’s popularity. Because of this, people at Netscape started taking Microsoft’s web plan lightly.</ins>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <h4>Pearl Harbour Attack</h4>
                            <p>
                                On 7th December 1995, the same day when Japan attacked Pearl Harbor in World War two, Bill gates held a press conference launching Internet Explorer version 2. His intentions were clear, he did not want to enter the market, he wanted to dominate it. &quot;Microsoft Takes War to the Net &quot;, such headlines were coming out. Both of the companies were releasing minor changes every month. The war was going at a rapid pace. One would release a minor change, the second would do the same to give a challenge.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h4>3.0 The Game Changer</h4>
                            <p>
                                <ins>Netscape navigator’s version 3.0</ins> was realized. It included Netscape’s javascript that was greatly influential. It included tables, background-colours, the archive attribute, the applet element, and new HTML tags such as blink and marquee. To counter the new version of Netscape Navigator, <ins>Microsoft launched the third version of Internet Explorer.</ins> This was the first time in the war when Netscape got serious competition. It included Cascading style sheets(CSS), which later became one of the three core technologies of the web that we still use today. Still, Netscape navigator had ninety per cent usage share of web browsers while Internet Explorer just had a nine per cent of it. The Netscape was still winning the war, but Bill Gates was keen on dominating the web browsing world.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                On 7th October 1997, the tides turned when Microsoft launched the Internet Explorer 4.0. The Internet Explorer 4.0 turned the tide</ins> the side of the Microsoft because they integrated the browser with the windows itself.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h4>The Last Nail In The Coffin</h4>
                            <p>
                                The Internet Explorer 4.0 turned the tide in the side of the Microsoft because they integrated the browser with the windows itself. This changed everything. The users didn’t need to get the web browser separately as it came along the Microsoft window. Microsoft already had ninety per cent usage share of the operating system and now the web browser was also coming with it. This greatly reduced installation efforts. The Netscape navigator never recovered and eventually lost the first browser war in 2001 when Internet Explorer 6.0 hit its peak share of ninety-six per cent.
                            </p>
                        </li>

                So, Microsoft won this war of web_browser. Though today Google is dominating player in term of web technologies around the world with over 60 per cent share.
