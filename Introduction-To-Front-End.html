                    Ever wonder what a front-end developer or back-end developer do every day? Read on to find out! You open a new browser tab, type in a URL, and press enter. The site loads instantly. It nearly takes your breath away with its ultra-clean layout, well-constructed pages, and impressive visuals. The people responsible for every part of that experience? Web developers. Let's talk about what is <strong>Front-End</strong> Web Devlopment:

                <h2>What is a Front-End?</h2>
                    <p>
                        The front end of a website is the part that users interact with. Everything that you see when you’re navigating around the Internet, from fonts and colors to dropdown menus and sliders, is a combo of <strong>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</strong> being controlled by your computer’s browser.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Everything you’re seeing on this website right now was made possible by a front-end developer. A designer crafted the logo and graphics, a photographer took the pictures, and a copywriter wrote the text. But a front-end dev assembled all of those pieces, translated them into web-speak, and built the experience you have with each page.

                <h3>Three Pillars of Front-End</h3>

                        <strong>HTML</strong>: Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets.

                    <li>
                        <strong>CSS</strong>:Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language like HTML.CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.[3] This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, and reduce complexity and repetition in the structural content.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <strong>JavaScript</strong>: As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles.JavaScript is the dominant client-side scripting language of the Web, with 95% of websites using it for this purpose. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but they are now embedded in some servers, usually via Node.js.
